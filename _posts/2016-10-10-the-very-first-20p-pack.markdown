I've just soldered my very first pack of 20 parallel 18650 cells. It doesn't look beautiful, but it seems to work fine.

![20 cells in parallel](/i/IMG_20161010_121708.jpg)

- cells are connected using 0.2&nbsp;mm copper wire (~€0.10 per 1 m)
- busbars are made of 1&nbsp;mm thick copper sheet, they are 10&nbsp;mm wide (~€0.20 per bus bar)
- the pack uses two 4×5 plastic cell spacers bought on AliExpress (~€0.5 per spacer)
- the module consists of 20 cells between 700 - 1500&nbsp;mAh each (it's made of lower quality cells), I expect it to have around 20&nbsp;Ah in total

A few thoughts so far:

- cutting busbars from a 1&nbsp;mm copper sheet is easier than I initially thought - the cheapest cutters do the job well
- I need a little bit more powerful soldering iron to solder cells and busbars - especially the bottom side of a cell is a challenge
- I'll try to make my cell spacers on my own (e.g. wooden ones)
