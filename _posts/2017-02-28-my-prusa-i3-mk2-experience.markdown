I've been watching the 3D printing world for quite some time now,
browsing through RepRap forums, thinking about building my own RepRap
printer - a budget way of getting into 3D printing. I didn't want to
spend a lot of money on it in fact, but there's one thing about
RepRaps that I really like - they give you much better understanding
of how 3D printers are implemented internally. It's something you
won't get by buying an off-the-shelf solution for sure.  However, I
received some feedback saying that it's very difficult to get a
consistent output from a RepRap. My friend who got into this business
a few years ago told me, that he's spent most of his time on
calibrating and setting the printer up. It was a challenge for him to
get similarly looking cubes printed multiple times in a row. The
amount of time he spent from assembling the printer and making it
actually work was tremendous.

The situation seems to have changed drastically
when
[Prusa i3 MK2](http://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/59-original-prusa-i3-mk2-kit.html) came
out. I've seen a lot of positive reviews of the printer recently, so I
decided to order a self-assembly DIY kit in the beginning of
December 2016. It was around €600 back then, but due to high demand,
it took almost two months to get it delivered. I received my kit at
the end of January.

I've spent around 8 hours total on assembling the printer, and I'd
like to say it loud: it was a lot of fun! I had some issues with
connecting the LCD display and control panel, but I figured out I
connected the 10-pin connector just like I thought it's supposed to be
connected - usually the red cable marks the first pin of the header,
but it turns out it's the other way around in Prusa. Fortunately, I
didn't fry anything and after fixing the connector everything started
to work just fine, or rather I should say: it started to work just
great! From the very first print, the results were amazing! Most of
the calibration has been done automatically, the only thing I needed
to manually set up was the nozzle distance from the heatbed, which was
very straightforward. I've almost finished my 1 kg PLA spool that I've
received with the printer and **I'm absolutely astonished**.
