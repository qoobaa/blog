I just wanted to see what happens if a short appears in the circuit - to check if the fuses I made really work. Here you go.

The first fuse didn't blow, because fuses are on both sides of the module - some on the negative side blew, breaking the circuit. One more thing to check is to see how much current actually went through the wire. I'll try to get a proper ammeter soon and repeat the test.
